# Changelog

All notable changes to this recipe. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-10-20

### Changed

- **The README now says which console this was tested on, and which one it was not.** Everything here
  was built and measured on an **Xbox Series X** in Developer Mode; a **Series S has never been tried**,
  so nothing here says anything about one. The wording used to say "Xbox Series", which reads as if it
  covered both, and it does not.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-10-16

### Fixed

- **`LICENSE`: the explanatory block named the wrong project.** Everything after the MIT text had
  been copied from another repository in this catalogue and never adapted: it said this was a
  derivative of a different project altogether, denied granting rights in a game that is not this
  one, quoted "the 57 lines of the upstream project", and listed folders this repository does not
  have. The MIT grant itself was correct all along, and `NOTICE.md` always had the right figures.
  The block now names JRickey/BattleShip (MIT) and Super Smash Bros., and points at `NOTICE.md` for
  the measurements instead of repeating a number.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-14

First release. The package built this way has been on an Xbox Series X since 2026-09-20.

### Included

- `patches/01-package-all-tiles.patch`: the tile list in the author's UWP CMake becomes a glob, so
  no tile stays out of the package by being missing from a hard-coded list.
- `package/Package.appxmanifest`: the manifest as it ended up, identity blanked to `CHANGE-ME`.
- `tools/`: `ssb_empaquetar.ps1` and `ssb_parche_uwp.py`.
- Documentation in English and Spanish, including the traps that are not in the author's README.

### Not included, on purpose

The UWP port itself, which is the author's and lives on the `codex/uwp-perf-trace` branch of
[JRickey/BattleShip](https://github.com/JRickey/BattleShip). This repository is the packaging half; `NOTICE.md`
measures exactly what is quoted from the author's tree: six context lines.
